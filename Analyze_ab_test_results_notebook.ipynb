Considering the probability of conversion regardless of the page received, it is obtained a value of around 11.96%, therefore, in order to have evidence that the new page lead to more conversions, we wold expect that the conversion rate for those that received the new page is higher. However, the old and new page have a conversion rate with similar numbers, with values of respectively around 12,04% and 11,88%. Those values do not give evidence that the new treatment page performs better, but that it is more likelly that the old and new page have similar conversion rates."

    "## Conclusions\n",
    "The aim of the present project was to identify if individuals being presented to a certain landing page would increase the conversion rate for an e-commerce website. The main outcome of the project is to identify if a new page should be implemented, keep the old page or run the experiment for a longer period.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to achieve such results, first, the data was organized and the DataFrame was updated. Next, some probabilities were computed in order to understand the values in the data frame and identify a possible issue for hypothesis testing. Finally, an A/B test was run in order to identify which page could lead to a higher conversion rate. This test was run considering an estimate from the null and calculating the z-score. In both cases, we fail to reject the null hypothesis and have evidence that the old page has a similar conversion rate as the new page.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, it was performed a regression approach, in which the data was fitted to the Logistic Regression Model. First, it was considered a model with information only about the landing page (if new or old). Afterward, it was included information about the country in which the user was accessing the website and considered the interaction between country and landing page. \n",
    "Considering this approach, we failed to reject the null hypothesis in both cases (the null hypothesis was that the independent variable had no significant effect on the target variable).\n",
    "\n",
    "As a final outcome, considering all the results obtained during this project, it is possible to conclude that **there is evidence that the old and new page leads to a similar conversion rate**. Moreover, there is no independent variable among the presented variables that are statistically significant in predicting the conversion rate if a Logistic Regression Model is used."
